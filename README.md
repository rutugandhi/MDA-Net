# MDA-Net
Segmenting an entire 3D image often has high computational complexity and requires large memory consumption; by contrast, performing volumetric segmentation in a slice-by-slice manner is efficient but does not fully leverage the 3D data. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-dimensional attention network (MDA-Net) to efficiently integrate slice-wise, spatial, and channel-wise attention into a U-Net based network, which results in high segmentation accuracy with a low computational cost. We evaluate our model on the MICCAI iSeg and IBSR datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.
